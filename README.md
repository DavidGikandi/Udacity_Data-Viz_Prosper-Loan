## by (David Gikandi)


## Dataset

> The prosper loan dataset is provided by Udacity to be used for the completion of the third project in the data analysis nanodegree. Prosper loan is a p2p lending platform where lenders, herein known as investors, come together to offer borrowers loan amounts. The borrowers credibility is determine by variables such as income range, employment status, home ownership, loan term, among others. The dataset, contains 113,937 rows and 81 columns.

## Summary of Findings

> The most preffered loan term is the 36 months with over 80,000 loans, followed by 60 months with slightly above 20,000 loans. 12 months term is the least preffered loan term. The loan term is normaly distributed against the prosper score. With high number of loans in both 36 and 60 months being between theprosper score of 4 and 8. While the extreme prosper scores have reduced number of loan count.

> The prosper score has a normal distribution. We can see that rating 4, 6, and 8 are the most common respectively. With the extreme ratings of 1 and 11 being the the least common respectively. There exist a positive correlation between the Prosper score and the loan amount. From the scatter diagram, we see that there are very few high loans (above 20,000) offered to borrowers with a lo score. However, as the borrower score increases, we a rise in the number of high amount loans given.

>The loan amount distribution is multimodal, with the least amount being 1,000 and the highest amount being around 36,000. With the most common amount borrowed being slightly below 5,000 with 14,000 loans given, followed by loan amount of 15,000 with more than 12,000 loans given. The correlation between the Investors and the loan amount is 0.380. This implies that as the loan amount increases even more investors will be needed to finance the loan.

> The loan status has 12 categories, out of which the current loan status has the highest number with more than 55,000 loans. While the second most popular category is the completed status with more than 35,000 loans. With almost little to no cancelled loans.

> On looking at the income range. I found that most of the borrowers fall under the middle income ranges of 25,000-49,000 and 50,000-74,999 with the former having the highest number of borrowers.There are no borrowers who earn over 75,000+.

> Although there are more home owners, the home ownership data shows an almost equal distribution of borrowers who own a home and those who do not. With a 50.4% to 49.6% ditribution respectively.

> Between the retired borrowers and the number of loans I found an interesting relationship. The retired borrowers had a near zero number of loans. With the assumption that retired borrowers have more assets compared to other borrowers, this observation came as a surprise.

## Key Insights for Presentation

> For the presentaion, the focus was on features that affect the borrower rate. To begin with, I looked at the borrower rate distribution. Secondly, I looked at the correlation between borrower rate vs loan amount vs investors. The relationship between employment status and the loan term was also explored. Finally, borrower rate relationship to income range and prosper score was also investigated.
